# connect-things
Connect your things.

This supports a general architecture for providing connections to things.
The only things realized now are
Switch and Dimmer devices reachable through a local [Legrand Adorne LC7001 hub](https://www.legrand.us/adorne/products/wireless-whole-house-lighting-controls/lc7001.aspx).
The only connections realized now are
UPnP through a SmartThings hub and
direct SmartThings schema connections to the SmartThings cloud.


The [Legrand Adorne Wi-Fi Ready Switch, Dimmer Switch and Outlet devices](https://www.legrand.us/adorne/products/wireless-whole-house-lighting-controls.aspx) will be discovered as device URNs
* schemas-upnp-org:device:BinaryLight:1
* schemas-upnp-org:device:DimmableLight:1

Which correspond to
* [OCF UPnP BinaryLight](http://upnp.org/specs/ha/UPnP-ha-BinaryLight-v1-Device.pdf)
* [OCF UPnP DimmableLight](http://upnp.org/specs/ha/UPnP-ha-DimmableLight-v1-Device.pdf)

A companion project is [upnp-connect](https://github.com/rtyle/upnp-connect) which connects these things through a local SmartThings hub to SmartThings device types with Switch and SwitchLevel capabilities. Together, these projects may be used to replace SmartThings to Legrand Adorne LC7001 hub integration through Samsungâ€™s ARTIK Cloud. Samsung has abandoned the ARTIK Cloud and Legrand has no plans to provide an alternative. This is an alternative.
