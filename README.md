# connect-things
Connect your things.

This supports a general architecture for providing connections to things.
The only things realized now are
Switch and Dimmer devices reachable through a local [Legrand Adorne LC7001 hub](https://www.legrand.us/adorne/products/wireless-whole-house-lighting-controls/lc7001.aspx).

The [Legrand Adorne Wi-Fi Ready Switch, Dimmer Switch and Outlet devices](https://www.legrand.us/adorne/products/wireless-whole-house-lighting-controls.aspx) will be discovered as device URNs
* schemas-upnp-org:device:BinaryLight:1
* schemas-upnp-org:device:DimmableLight:1

Which correspond to
* [OCF UPnP BinaryLight](http://upnp.org/specs/ha/UPnP-ha-BinaryLight-v1-Device.pdf)
* [OCF UPnP DimmableLight](http://upnp.org/specs/ha/UPnP-ha-DimmableLight-v1-Device.pdf)

The only connections realized now are a
UPnP connection through a SmartThings hub and a
SmartThings Cloud Connector Schema App.

This project may be used to replace SmartThings to Legrand Adorne LC7001 hub integration through Samsungâ€™s ARTIK Cloud.
Samsung has abandoned the ARTIK Cloud and Legrand has no plans to provide an alternative.
This is an alternative.

## Installation

**connect-things** is a JavaScript application that expects to be run in a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) environment.
It was developed using, at the time, the *Latest LTS Version: 12.18.3* of nodejs.
**connect-things** can be installed by [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
and the Node Package Manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
You can use these, as a normal user, to install **connect-things** with all of its dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/rtyle/connect-things
(cd connect-things; npm install)
```
To inspect the **connect-things** command line options and run it:
```
node . --help
node .
```

## UPnP Connection Through a SmartThings Hub

A companion project is [upnp-connect](https://github.com/rtyle/upnp-connect) which connects these things through a local SmartThings hub to SmartThings device types with Switch and SwitchLevel capabilities.

Since only the SmartThings hub will need access, it is recommended to exclude all others ...
```
node . --upnp-host smartthings.home
```
... where *smartthings.home* resolves to the SmartThings hub (use IP address otherwise).

## SmartThings Cloud Connector Schema App

Assuming that SmartThings will not be able to reach the connect-things service directly,
an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (or equivalent) tunnel to it will be required.
One side of the tunnel should target the port (default, 8081) of the connect-things host/service
and the other side of the tunnel should be identified reliably with your custom [subdomain](https://ngrok.com/docs#http-subdomain).
For example,

```
ngrok http -subdomain=yoursubdomainhere 8081
```

Replace *yoursubdomainhere* (above and below) with your chosen, unique, reliable custom [subdomain](https://ngrok.com/docs#http-subdomain).

The
[SmartThings Developer Workspace](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace)
must be used to create a
[project](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace/projects).
The
[new project](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/workspace/projects/new)
should be created for this
**Device Integration**
with a
**SmartThings Cloud Connector**
of type
**SmartThings Schema Connector**.
After naming your project, the next step will be to
**Register App**
of the
*Cloud Connector*.
It will be a
**Webhook Endpoint**
with a
*Target URL*
of
```
https://yoursubdomainhere.ngrok.io/c2c/resource
```

Set up the
*credentials required to access the cloud which hosts the devices*
(connect-things).
Follow the instructions in
[etc/c2cClientLocal.js](https://github.com/rtyle/connect-things/blob/master/etc/c2cClientLocal.js)
to generate (and remember) your own unique id and secret for the connect-things (local) client
and use these to fill in the
**Client ID**
and
**Client Secret**
fields.

The
**Authorization URI**
should be reachable from the device running the SmartThings app used to onboard connect-things.
It is most secure (and advised) if this device is connected to the same LAN as the connect-things host.
For example ...
```
https://connect-things.home:8082/c2c/oauth2/authorize
```
* where *connect-things.home* resolves to the host running connect-things (use IP address otherwise),
* connect-things is running an http service on port 8081 (default)
* and an https service on the next port (8082), dedicated to phone.home, which will only be so if run with the
```
--c2c-auth phone.home
```
... option where phone.home resolves to the host running the SmartThings app (use IP address otherwise) used to onboard connect-things.

The
**Token URI**
must be reachable from SmartThings.
```
https://yoursubdomainhere.ngrok.io/c2c/oauth2/token
```

The optional
**OAuth Scope(s)**
should be left empty.

Next, fill in the
**App Display Name**
with, say
"connect-things"
and choose a logo, say
[connect-c2c-things.png](https://github.com/rtyle/connect-things/blob/master/connect-c2c-things.png)

**Copy**
the your own unique SmartThings (remote)
**Client ID**
and
**Client Secret**
and paste (remember) them into
[etc/c2cClientRemote.js](https://github.com/rtyle/connect-things/blob/master/etc/c2cClientRemote.js).

You can then **Deploy to Test**.

Run connect-things for first-time onboarding.
```
rm -f etc/c2cCallbackAuthentication.json
rm -f etc/c2cCallbackUrls.json
node . --c2c-oauth phone.home
```
Any etc/c2cCallback*.json files are removed first because they will be overwritten
as part of establishing a new relationship with SmartThings.
Old content will probably not work.
Expect
```
<timestamp> [ERROR] c2c - < <deviceFriendlyName> callback undefined
```
messages from each device until the new relationship is forged.

From the SmartThings app (run on phone.home),
[enable Developer Mode](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/testing/developer-mode.html)
then add
(**+**)
a
**Device**
by
**device type**.
Scroll to the bottom and click
**My Testing Devices**.
Under
*My setup apps*,
click
**connect-things**.
Select the
**Location**
and
**Room**
that devices will be added to and click
**Next**.

The local SmartThings app should automatically be authenticated and tokens should be exchaged between connect-things and SmartThings.
```
Connection between SmartThings and connect-things is successful
Close this page to finish setup.
```
Close the page.
```
Successfully connected to connect-things.
```
Click
**Done**.



## Automatic Run

From the connect-things host, change directory to where it is 
One should be able to make this run automatically in most environments.
It has been tested to run on Linux.
### Run as a Linux systemd service
As root,
```
cp connect-things/connect-things.service /etc/systemd/system/
```
